        <h2 style="color: green;">Recycling</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Recycling rates are increasing in the UK, but so is our population. To fulfill demand,
          we're producing more goods and using more natural resources than ever before, but despite our best efforts, we
          are still throwing too many things away.</p>

      <div class="box box-cycle">
        <h2 style="color: green;">CYCLE</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Cycling is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be enjoyed by people of all ages,
          from young children to older adults. It is also fun, cheap, and good for the environment. Riding to work is a
          great way to get into a routine.</p>

      <div class="box box-solar-panel">
        <h2 style="color: blue;">Solar Panel</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Solar power is the most abundant energy source on Earth. There's enough solar energy
          hitting the Earth every hour to meet all of humanity's power needs for an entire year. Every ounce of oil,
          every lump of coal, and every cubic foot of natural gas could be left in the ground if only we could capture
          one hour's worth of solar energy each year. That's the scale of the opportunity..</p>

      <div class="box box-light-bulb">
        <h2 style="color: blue;">Energy Efficient Light Bulb</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">Energy efficiency is all about squeezing out every last bit of power, and not letting
          any go to waste. So, an energy-saving bulb uses less electricity to emit the same amount of light as a
          traditional bulb. It's astonishing to know that only 10% of energy used in traditional incandescent bulbs is
          converted to light. The other 90% is lost as heat.</p>
